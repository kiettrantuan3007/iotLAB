# How to run

We need some library to be able to run that code, and we created the requirements.txt to you can add library easily just by this command:

```cli
cd build
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And after a minute which all library installed, you can run it by using this command line: 
```cli
python gui.py
```
Since this app is at code, so you can run it on both Windows and Ubuntu (and MacOS, of course)
